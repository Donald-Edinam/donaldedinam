                        I work at the intersection of frontend engineering, design systems, and product thinking.

                        My experience spans real-world platforms — from internal tools to customer-facing products — where clarity, performance, and maintainability matter more than novelty.

                        I care deeply about how software is structured, not just how it looks.
