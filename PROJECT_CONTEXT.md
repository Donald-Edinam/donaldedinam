# PROJECT CONTEXT

## 1. Project Identity

This project is a personal portfolio for a frontend-focused software engineer operating at a global, senior-adjacent level.

It is not a résumé.
It is not a template.
It is a product.

The site must communicate clarity of thought, taste, and technical depth through restraint rather than volume.

---

## 2. Target Audience

Primary:
- Senior engineers
- Tech leads
- Design-aware founders
- Product-driven teams

Secondary:
- Recruiters who can recognize quality when it is presented clearly

This site is not designed for beginners or mass appeal.

---

## 3. Brand Positioning

Positioning statement:

> A frontend engineer who treats interfaces as systems, not screens.

The brand sits at the intersection of:
- Engineering discipline
- Design literacy
- Long-term thinking

We do not over-explain.
We let structure, pacing, and execution speak.

## 4. Design Philosophy

- Design is structural before it is aesthetic
- Whitespace is intentional, not empty
- Typography carries more meaning than decoration
- Motion is purposeful, never ornamental

Visual decisions must feel inevitable, not clever.

---

## 5. Technical Philosophy

- Architecture over hacks
- Semantic abstractions over shortcuts
- Systems over components
- Predictability over novelty

Code should be legible to a senior engineer in under 60 seconds.

---

## 6. Non-Goals

This project will NOT:
- Chase trends
- Showcase every skill
- Optimize for SEO hacks
- Mimic popular portfolios
- Use heavy animations or visual noise

If a feature exists only to impress, it does not belong here.

---

## 7. Quality Bar

Every decision must satisfy at least one of the following:
- Improves clarity
- Improves longevity
- Improves credibility

If it does none of the above, it is removed.

---

## 8. Decision Rules

When in doubt:
1. Choose clarity over personality
2. Choose restraint over expression
3. Choose systems over instances
4. Choose boring correctness over clever mistakes
